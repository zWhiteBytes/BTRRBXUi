# USE PIZZABOXER'S https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap INSTEAD, IT HAS PERSISTENT FILE MODS.
# IF YOU STILL WANT TO USE THIS:
# BTRRBXUI (formerly BTRRBXBar/HUD) (windows & linux)

btrrbxui is a python script to replace roblox ui assets
the asset change, however, is not persistent and you have to re-run the script
when roblox updates (thats why i made it, its annoying to replace it over and over)

# Well, how do I run it?

have python (at least 3.6 and up), download the code, unzip it and just run the python script.
(if on linux, use the terminal)

# But how do I open the menu now? (invisible-presets)

you have two choices:

1. click the now-invisible button
2. simply press 'esc'

# How do I make a custom preset?

all you need to do is get the "Original" preset, unzip it and you'll see the png's you need to edit. 
as long as you edit it and dont mess with the resolution, you're good to go.

me personally i'd use paint.net, but you can use whatever
also an reminder, you do not have to edit size variants (i think)

# why did you already rename this 3 times

first it was HUD because i was dumb
second BAR because it replaced topbar assets
third UI since it can replace UI assets instead
