# BTRRBXUI (formerly BTRRBXBar/HUD) (windows & linux)

btrrbxui is a python script to replace roblox ui assets
the asset change, however, is not permanent and you have to re-run the script
when roblox updates (literally why i made it)

# Well, how do I run it?

have python (at least 3.6 and up), download the code, unzip it and just run the python script.
(if on linux, use the terminal)

# But how do I open the menu now? (invisible-presets)

you have two choices:

1. click the now-invisible button
2. simply press 'esc'

# How do I make a custom preset?

all you need to do is get the "Original" preset, unzip it and you'll see the png's you need to edit. 
as long as you edit it and dont mess with the resolution, you're good to go.

me personally i'd use paint.net, but you can use whatever
also an reminder, you have to edit size variants (if @2x or @3x exists for that file)

# why did you already rename this 3 times

first it was HUD bcs i was dumb
second BAR bcs it replaced topbar assets
third UI since it can replace UI assets
